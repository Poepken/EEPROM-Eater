# EEPROM-Eater
EEPROM programmer code for Ben Eater Project - improved code

To erase / program / read EEPROMs like 28C16 or 28C64 
with the help of an Arduino Nano and 2 shift registers

The original is here: https://github.com/beneater/eeprom-programmer where 
you will also find a schematic.

I have messed around with a few cheap Chinese EEPROMs and have added a few 
things to the original code to improve reliability.

This includes some fixes from here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/beneater/comments/cc3o76/issues_programming_28c1620pc_200ns_eeproms_with/
